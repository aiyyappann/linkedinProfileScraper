    "about": "As a Unity 3D Developer at AMMACHI Labs, I contributed to the creation of interactive simulations for students at Industrial Training Institutes (ITI) and National Skill Training Institutes (NSTI) in India. These simulations aimed to enhance the learning experience for electronic mechanics and solar technician students by making complex concepts accessible and engaging.I have a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, where I gained a solid foundation in software development and problem-solving skills. I am also certified in MTA: Security Fundamentals by Microsoft and also finished GCP Associate Cloud Engineer roadmap by Google Cloud Skills Boost, demonstrating my proficiency in cloud computing and security. Additionally, I have completed a course in Business Analytics for Decision Making from the University of Colorado Boulder, which has helped me apply data-driven insights to improve project outcomes.As a Unity 3D Developer at AMMACHI Labs, I contributed to the creation of interactive simulations for students at Industrial Training Institutes (ITI) and National Skill Training Institutes (NSTI) in India.
